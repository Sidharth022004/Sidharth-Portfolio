## How It Works

2. **Client-side validation** ensures all fields are properly filled
3. **Rate limiting** prevents spam by enforcing a 1-minute cooldown between submissions
4. **Input sanitization** cleans the data before sending

7. **Form resets** automatically after successful submission

## Email Template Variables

The following variables are sent to your EmailJS template:

- `{{from_name}}` - Sender's name
- `{{from_email}}` - Sender's email address
- `{{subject}}` - Message subject
- `{{message}}` - Message content

- `{{to_email}}` - Your email (sidharthkardam287@gmail.com)
- `{{reply_to}}` - Reply-to address (sender's email)

## EmailJS Template Setup

Make sure your EmailJS template (`template_99niu0d`) includes these fields:

**Subject Line**: `New Contact Form Message: {{subject}}`

**Email Body**:
```
Hello {{to_name}},

You have received a new message from your portfolio contact form:

From: {{from_name}} ({{from_email}})
Subject: {{subject}}

Message:
{{message}}

---
You can reply directly to this email to respond to {{from_name}}.

Sent from your portfolio website.
```
